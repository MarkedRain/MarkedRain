# This file contains the folders to be created during
# the making of MarkedRain Operating System. The format
# is as follows:
#
#       root/<directory>
#
# where "directory" is the name of the dir you want to
# create. All entries must begin with "root". It will get
# replaced with whatever the root directory is, as
# defined in the makefile "bin_dir_raw" variable.
#
# Directores with spaces in them should look like this:
#
#       root/hello world with spaces
#
# You don't need to put quotes or do anything extra.
# That also means you cannot put comments following
# any folder entries, else they would be treated as
# part of the folder's name.
