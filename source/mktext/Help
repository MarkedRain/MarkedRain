-This folder contains /bin/sh scripts

-These scripts are used to generate text files deemed long for use in main Makefile

-These scripts can substituite exported Makefile variable values for use in the generated text files

-To properly create a script, follow these guidelines

  + Put '#!/bin/sh' and 'cat <<EOF' at the start, and 'EOF' at the last line.
  + Use '\$' wherever you want '$' to be in the final text
  + Use '$' for variables whose value have already been exported from Makefile.

-Makefile (or some other program) is expected to capture the output of these scripts and redirect them to its destination.

-You can do any calculations or other stuff within the script to get the necessary values before the 'cat <<EOF' bit.
