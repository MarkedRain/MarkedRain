        Microwindows or Nano-X is a small graphical windowing system that implements
        both Win32 and Nano-X (X11-like) APIs for clipped graphics drawing in windows
        on Linux, Mac OS X, EMSCRIPTEN, Android and other platforms. It is Open Source
        and licenced under the the Mozilla Public License. For creating GUIs, the
        Nuklear immediate mode GUI, Win32 builtin controls, and TinyWidget's controls
        based on Nano-X are included. FLTK can be used with the X11 compability
        library NX11.
