In source/scripts, create a new script that looks through a file which has all the folders to be created in the distro like this:

    Sy/global
    Sy/global/new_folder
    Sy/new folder with spaces & symbols!
    Sy/../superuser

And ignoring any lines that start with "#", This should be at top:

#
# This file contains the folders to be created during
# the making of MarkedRain Operating System. The format
# is as follows:
#
#       Sy/<directory>
#
# where "directory" is the name of the dir you want to
# create. "Sy" means the System folder. All entries
# must begin with "Sy". It will get replaced with
# whatever the system directory is (eg. "System").
# If you want to create a directory on the root itself,
# do it as "Sy/../<directory".
#
# Crap note: Comments must have '#' as the first character,
# putting it anywhere else wouldn't make it a comment.
#

That script has the code to ignore lines starting with "#", and to replace "Sy" (DETECT IT AS THE FIRST TWO CHARS, IF IT ISN'T, SKIP THAT LINE!!!) with makefile's bin_dir_sys.
