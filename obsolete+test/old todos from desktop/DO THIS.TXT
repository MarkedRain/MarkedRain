IMPROVEMENT: CHANGE THE STEP IN MRAIN MAKEFILE FROM THIS:

<extract rootfs into bin/temp/rootfs>
<copy rootfs into bin/extract>

TO THIS:

<extract rootfs into bin/extract>

FOR EVEN MORE PERFORMANCE!!!!!!


ALSO, DO make clean ON BUILDROOT && CHANGE SETTINGS TO ONLY INCLUDE "SUDO" "BUILDROOT (INDIVID BINARIES)" "OPENRC".


ALSO!! MAKE IT SO THAT IN MAIN MRAIN MAKEFILE, SAVE THE HASH OF THE LATEST rootfs.tar FILE. WHEN THE NEXT TIME, CHECK IF THE NEW rootfs.tar FILE'S HASH IS THE SAME. IF SO, DO NOT COPY THE STUFF!!!

10:36 pm 15-6-24 the above idea is elaborated:

First, check if "rootfs.tar" exists. If it doesn't, immediately invoke make & save hash of .config. If it exists, compare the hash of the ".config" file with a previous one saved. If they match, just copy stuff within "rootfs.tar" like usual, but without invoking the make on buildroot, saving time. If the hashes doesn't match with the previous one, invoke make & then copy the new rootfs.tar yada yada...
