            an effort to increase performance and reduce any
            disk degradation.

            It does this by creating a symlink to
            '/dev/shm/mrain-bin'.

            Any contents stored within it will be lost when the
            computer loses power.

            made, and its extracted contents (if bool_clean_dir_tmp

            Usually, the image will be of the total size of the

            This option enables the use of drive letters for partitions in the shell.
            When enabled, the user can switch to mountpoints by typing a drive letter
            followed by a colon (e.g., 'C:'), provided that a corresponding folder
            exists in /boot/disks. This allows a simplified method of navigating
            mountpoints using familiar drive letter notation.

            Example:
                If the user types "C:" and the folder "/boot/disks/C:" exists, the shell
                will automatically change the current directory to "/boot/disks/C:".

            Only works with ZSH.

            Note: To remove drive letters fully, you MUST re-compile the linux kernel
                  without applying the namei.c patch, because the kernel is the one
                  who transforms stuff like 'nano c:/log.txt' into

            This option allows you to connect the serial port of the QEMU
            screen to a new terminal automatically (parameter -serial pty).
            If you disable this option, serial output will not be displayed.

            - If you want serial output to be displayed IN THE TERMINAL WHERE
              QEMU IS LAUNCHED, then add parameter (to ulti_vm_params):

                -serial stdio

            Only enable if UTIL_VM is QEMU!
