            Microwindows or Nano-X is a small graphical windowing system that implements
            both Win32 and Nano-X (X11-like) APIs for clipped graphics drawing in windows
            on Linux, Mac OS X, EMSCRIPTEN, Android and other platforms. It is Open Source
            and licenced under the the Mozilla Public License. For creating GUIs, the
            Nuklear immediate mode GUI, Win32 builtin controls, and TinyWidget's controls
            based on Nano-X are included. FLTK can be used with the X11 compability
            library NX11.

            v86d provides a backend for kernel drivers that need to execute
            x86 BIOS code.  The code is executed in a controlled environment
            and the results are passed back to the kernel via the netlink
            interface.

            The VM software is used to run the iso image created with
            make. If you change this to anything other than QEMU, change
            the parameters too to make it work with that software.

            Enabling the QEMU KVM acceleration can give exceptional performance to
            the VM launched. You may enable this ONLY if the VM software is QEMU,
            as it passes the parameters '-enable-kvm -cpu host'.

            This only works if KVM itself is enabled and used on your computer.
            Makefile automatically runs 'kvm-ok'.

            These parameters will be directly sent to the VM software
            by appending it to the end of its filename. Different
            VM software may have different ways of interpreting the 
            same thing, so do your research before modifying this.
